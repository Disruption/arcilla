Lightweight HTTP server for quick REST API mocking using Java SE

The basic idea after arcilla is to be able to set up very quickly an http server that offers rest endpoints.

It is fairly easy to implement one in with Java Enterprise Edition, but it also usually takes more resources (Probably requiring you to use GlassFish or similar base servers), and is more convoluted for a first mocking phase.

It also serves for when you are developing the client side, and you know the specification of the remote API but it's not there yet, or you don't have access at the moment, or just you don't have internet available for whatever reason.
